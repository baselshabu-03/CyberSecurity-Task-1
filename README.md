# CyberSecurity-Task-1

I was using these tools for the first time. 
After Installing the Nmap tool for the first time there was a command by default,
nmap -T4 -A -v

Then I went to command prompt and "Run as Administrator". Entered "ipconfig" to get the IP Address.

Getting the Local IP range I have executed the command "nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24".

It took some time and showed how many ports and IP addresses were found.

I did not understand the part were we have analyse the potential risk.

Once, it is done I saved the file into 'txt', by executing this command, "nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN scan.txt"
